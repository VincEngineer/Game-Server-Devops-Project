# Game-Server-Devops-Project

With this project, we will Automate the game server installation of Silkroad Community. (Feel free to Find more info about Silkroad Online and the community on google).

We will need five things here:
1. Install the SQL server 2017/2019, restoring the three databases called (SRO_VT_SHARD, SRO_VT_ACCOUNT, SRO_VT_SHARDLOG)

2. The Game server installer. (on a public static IP address)
#MEGA LINk FOR the Game server installer:

3. The SRO game client:

4. the IP injector for the client to connect to the game server.

Note: I will soon Upload a video on youtube to clearly explain how to install this, but it is not hard since I manage to automate almost everything.
Probably antivirus will pop up since many things are by Injections/Cracked and 32bits, which we will need to add the execution prevention 'DEP' to our game client to run.
