# Game-Server-Devops-Project

With this project, we will Automate the game server installation of Silkroad Community. (Feel free to Find more info about Silkroad Online and the community on google).

We will need five things here:
1. Install the SQL server 2017/2019, restoring the three databases called (SRO_VT_SHARD, SRO_VT_ACCOUNT, SRO_VT_SHARDLOG)
